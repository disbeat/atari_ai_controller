'''
Script for extracting features from EMG signals for training the classifier

It expects the existence of a pickle file with the names of each
condition in the data folder

To run, provide the window duration for the segmentation (in ms) as argument.

Ex: "python3 prepare_train_emg.py 250" split the signals in segments of 250ms and 
extract features for each segment
