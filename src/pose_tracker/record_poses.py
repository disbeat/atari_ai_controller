# Script for recording pose snapshots of a specific condition
# 
# To use, specify the condition name and recording duration (in seconds)
# as the first two arguments.
# 
# Ex: "python3 record_poses.py left 30" will record data for the left 
# condition during 30 seconds, and save it in the file fire.pkl in the 
# data folder.
